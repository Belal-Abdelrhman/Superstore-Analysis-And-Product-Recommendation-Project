# Superstore-Product-Recommendation-Analysis-Project

## Project Background
This project aims to enhance product recommendations and analyze sales trends using data from the Superstore dataset. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering customers based on sales behavior, and developing a personalized product recommendation system. The insights generated help businesses understand customer purchasing patterns, optimize marketing efforts, and improve overall profitability.

Dataset Structure
The dataset contains customer transactions from an online retail platform, capturing key attributes such as:

Customer Data: Customer ID, Name, Segment, and Region.
Sales Data: Order details, product purchases, quantity, discount, and profit.
Product Information: Product categories, subcategories, and names.
The dataset consists of 10,000+ records with 36 columns, covering purchases across different regions and time periods.

Executive Summary
This project follows a structured approach to analyzing customer purchase behaviors and improving product recommendations using K-Means clustering and collaborative filtering techniques.

## Key Findings:
The "Consumer" segment contributes the highest profitability.
California is the top-performing state in terms of sales and profit.
Certain regions, like North Dakota, show underperformance, indicating potential marketing opportunities.
A personalized recommendation system was built to suggest relevant products based on customer purchase history and similarities within customer clusters.
