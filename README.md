# Superstore Product Recommendation & Sales Analysis
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchasing behaviors and enhances product recommendations using the Superstore dataset. The analysis helps businesses understand sales trends, optimize marketing efforts, and increase profitability.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Structure
The dataset consists of 10,000+ transactions with 36 columns, covering purchases across different regions and time periods. It includes:
### ðŸ”¹ Customer Data â€“ ID, Name, Segment, and Region.
### ðŸ”¹ Sales Data â€“ Order details, Quantity, Discount, and Profit.
### ðŸ”¹ Product Information â€“ Categories, Subcategories, and Product Names.

## ðŸ“Š Executive Summary
We implemented K-Means clustering for customer segmentation and collaborative filtering for personalized product recommendations. Key insights include:
### âœ… The "Consumer" segment is the most profitable.
### âœ… California leads in sales & profit.
### âœ… North Dakota underperforms, presenting an opportunity for targeted marketing.
### âœ… A GUI-based recommendation system was built for product suggestions based on customer clusters.

## âš  Assumptions & Caveats
### ðŸ”¸ The recommendation system assumes that customer preferences remain consistent over time.
### ðŸ”¸ External factors like market trends or competitor actions were not considered.
### ðŸ”¸ The clustering model may require adjustments as new customer behavior emerges.

## ðŸ“Œ Final Thoughts
This project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making. By combining customer segmentation and recommendation systems, businesses can boost profitability, improve customer engagement, and optimize sales strategies. ðŸš€
